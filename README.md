# ThanosProject Description
A web application that removes approximately half of the tiles from the page upon clicking a button. Also allows user to add new tiles, reset the board, or clear all tiles.

# Background
I created this project mid-way through Colt Steele's web development course on Udemy to test out some of the concepts I have learned so far.
