# ThanosProject Description
A web application that decimates approximately half of the board at the click of a button. Similar (probably) to the upcoming Avengers movie though, it allows you to bring everyone back. You can also add additional tiles, or wipe out the board entirely and start fresh.

# Background
I created this project mid-way through Colt Steele's web development course on Udemy to test out some of the concepts I have learned so far.
